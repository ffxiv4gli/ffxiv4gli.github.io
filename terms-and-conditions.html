(A) Disputes. The terms of this section apply to all disputes between you and FFXIV4GIL, except those disputed by the above-referenced and Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy provided herein. For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;controversy&rdquo; shall mean any dispute, claim or suit arising out of or relating to any FFXIV4GIL service or product, FFXIV4GIL&#39;s website, these terms or any other transaction involving you and FFXIV4GIL between you and FFXIV4GIL. , whether in the contract, guarantee, misrepresentation, fraud, infringement, intentional infringement, statutes, regulations, regulations or any other legal or fair basis, should be interpreted as the broadest meaning of legal permission. You and FFXIV4GIL agree that the &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo; as defined in these Terms shall not contain any claims or causes of action caused by you or FFXIV4GIL as follows: (I) misleading trade secrets, (II) patent infringement, (III) copyright infringement or misuse and ( IV) Trademark infringement or disclosure. In addition, although there are other provisions in these terms, you agree that the court (rather than the arbitrator) can decide whether the claim is one of these four exceptions.<br>
(B) Constraint arbitration. You and FFXIV4GIL further agree to (i) arbitrate all disputes between the parties in accordance with these terms; (ii) these provisions alert the transactions in interstate commerce; (iii) the &ldquo;Federal Arbitration Act&rdquo; (9 USC &sect;1, Et Seq.)

Arbitration means that you waive the rights of the judge or jury in the trial proceedings and your reasons for appeal are limited. The arbitrator may award you the same compensation as the court that is sitting in the appropriate jurisdiction, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief, only to seek relief The individual party and provide the relief required by the party&rsquo;s individual claim only when necessary. In addition, in some cases, the cost of arbitration may exceed the cost of litigation, and the right to display evidence in arbitration may be more limited than the court. The arbitrator&#39;s decision is ultimately enforced by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.<br>
